# README

This repository is to present the [discovery specification](DESIGN-SPEC.md) OCI image discovery functionality, as part of [image-spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec). 

For OCI image distibution is a complex and wide system, and much implementation should will done, [discovery specification](DESIGN-SPEC.md) document just be separated from that, to achieve only consensual image discovery protocol.

The strategies in this document refer to existing great open implementations.
